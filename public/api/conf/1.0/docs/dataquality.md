"Breathing Space" individuals need to be matched within HMRC. HMRC will use a minimum combination of First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Current Address (except for Domestic Violence, Secure Customer Records etc), a debt associated with HMRC.

Additional identifiers (NINO, UTR, etc ) will also be collected by Insolvency Service and these may be used to enhance the matching activity.

Note that if the individual matching is not successful, based on the provided data, the "Breathing Space" event is still created within HMRC, and specific case matching activity is undertaken.
