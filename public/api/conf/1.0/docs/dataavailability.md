Breathing Space is a 2017 manifesto commitment. 

It will pause enforcement action; freeze interest, fees, and charges, and pause creditor contact with debtors where it relates to debt repayment for a 60-day period. 

These protections will be accessible via professional debt advice. During this period, individuals will receive professional debt advice to find a long-term solution to their financial difficulties.

The IT portal to support Breathing Space will be developed and administered by the Insolvency Service (external agency)  and used by debt advisers as well as creditors.

Details of the debtors will be available from the Insolvency Service which will be “pulled” by HMRC. Data consists of case information and Breathing Space period information (typically 60-day periods) managed within HMRC systems
